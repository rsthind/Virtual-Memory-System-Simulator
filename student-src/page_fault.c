    Page fault handler.

    When the CPU encounters an invalid address mapping in a page table,
    it invokes the OS via this handler.

    Your job is to put a mapping in place so that the translation can
    succeed. You can use free_frame() to make an available frame.
    Update the page table with the new frame, and don't forget
    to fill in the frame table.

    Lastly, you must fill your newly-mapped page with data. If the page has
    never been mapped before, you must read an empty page from disk space and
    update the diskmap. Otherwise, the data will ahve been swapped to the disk
    when the page was evicted last. Call swap_read() to pull the back in from
    swap space.

    HINTS:
         - You will need to use the global variable current_process when
           setting the frame table entry.
